# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)

## For Raspbian (Raspberry PI)
# Please note that this file is written to be used with dhcpcd
# For static IP, consult /etc/dhcpcd.conf and 'man dhcpcd.conf'

## NOTE THAT THE DEFAULT SETUP IS that wifi is managed by dhcpcd
# and wpasupplicant not networking (interfaces), everything
# but source-directory should be commented out.

# Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d
#source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface (Default uncomment for NetworkManager)
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
#allow-hotplug eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp

# Wifi network interface
#allow-hotplug wlan0
#iface wlan0 inet manual 
#   wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
#iface wlan0 inet dhcp
#    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

#iface default inet dhcp
